# Full Stack Project

## Description
* Your task is to build something awesome!
* You'll be using the backend (and front-end) skills you've developed over the last couple of months.
* Each team must present their project on the afternoon of the 5th class day.

## Technical Requirements: front-end
* It is recommended that you do not focus on CSS. Please (gently) use a library (ie. Bulma, Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize) for your styling.
  * [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Foundation](https://get.foundation/)
  * [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* Implement a simple Responsive Web Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide

## Technical Requirements: backend
* Use Express for your HTTP framework.
* Use a view engine for your templating
* Use PostgreSQL for your database
  * Create at least 3 tables, with Model classes as is appropriate
  * Make sure that at least 2 of the tables are related (via foreign keys)

## Recommended

* Allow user login, with passwords encrypted with bcrypt.
* Use Sequelize to create Models and Migrations

## Optionally

* Use only API routes that return JSON data. Store your static files in the 'public' folder.
* Incorporate data from an external API
* Deploy your application to one of your team member's heroku instance.
* Implement OAuth with Passport.js

## Workflow Requirements
* Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
