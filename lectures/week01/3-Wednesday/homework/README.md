# Box Model, Display, Centering, Positioning, Floats Homework

1. Layout practice! Header, footer, sidebar, and main

A very common layout for a website is to have the following elements:
- A header
- A footer
- Sidebar (on the left or right) that holds navigation links
- A main content area

[Here is an example diagram of the layout](https://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2-col-demo-sidebar-left.png)

Using your newly found CSS powers, implement this layout using the box model.

2. Positioning

Make the 2 column and Holy Grail layouts using absolute positioning.

- You will use a <div> element for each box you make
- you will use the left, top, width, and height CSS properties to positionthem into place, using percentage units so that the layout will adjust to the size of the browser window. 

<i>To allow you to see where the boxes are, you should give each box a different background color.</i>

3. More Box Model Practice 

Make the layout below using the Box Model.

<i>Use different color backgrounds so you can see the width and height of each column. Content for each column should have varying heights.</i>
