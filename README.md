# DigitalCrafts - Web-FT-07-2022

Welcome to DigitalCrafts!

This is your field guide to your March, 2023 Immersive cohort, and should provide you with information you need about what to expect in class week to week.

## What we will use this for
This repository is where we will upload code from the lesson (examples, assignments, etc) and track them after each lesson.  You can use this code as
a reference to help you with assignments, or to check on what homework is due.
